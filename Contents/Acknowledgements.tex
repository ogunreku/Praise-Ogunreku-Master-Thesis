I want to convey my heartfelt gratitude to my Supervisor, Prof Martin Kada, whose genuineness and encouragement I will never forget. Prof Kada has been an inspiration to me while I struggled through this Master's degree program. Furthermore, this thesis would not have been feasible without Amgad Agoub's supervision from the beginning of the research process, which allowed me to gain knowledge of the subject. I am grateful for the fantastic experiences he planned for me and the possibilities he provided for me to advance professionally. It is a privilege to learn from Prof. Martin Kada and Amgad Agoub.


I'd also want to thank my colleagues, Olumide Omole and Hassan El Hajj, for their effective feedback and programming suggestions during this project.


I am grateful to my parents, whose unwavering love and support keep me motivated and confident. My triumphs and success are the results of their faith in me. My heartfelt gratitude goes to my siblings, who keep me grounded, remind me of what is important in life, and always support my endeavors.


Finally, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to Anita, my wife. I am eternally grateful for the unending love and support I received daily throughout the this study.
